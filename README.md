# Royo Plays Music - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Royo Plays Music**, a personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a DJ and karaoke host. This website serves as an online presence where users can learn more about my events, connect via social media, and check out my recent projects.

## Features

- **Landing Page:** Simple and dramatic, with minimal elements for a focused aesthetic. Includes links to social media platforms like Instagram, SoundCloud, and GitHub.
- **Portfolio Links:** Quick access to Instagram for event photos and SoundCloud for music samples.
- **Contact and Social Links:** Social media logos with links for easy connection.

## Getting Started

To get the website running locally:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jisaiaha/royoplaysmusic.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**
   ```bash
   cd royoplaysmusic
   ```
3. **Open the index.html to preview the landing page.**

## File Structure

- **index.html** - The main HTML file for the landing page.

## Tech Stack

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to:

- **Develop an invoicing platform** to streamline payments and track finances. This platform will allow:
  - Creation of both **hour-based** and **gig-based** invoices.
  - Tracking of **balances owed by venues** or **clients** who request events.
